# Project 3 Reflection

After completing Project 3, I feel as though I have a fairly good idea of how to work through a project that requires modeling. In this project, we set up a project in github, imported and cleaned the data for
analysis, did basic exploratory data analysis, fit various models, and selected the best one. On top of this, we automated the process and created reports for different levels of a variable in the data set.
My partner and I did a great job at managing our time and having good communication throughout the process. We were successful by following the instructions and doing the work as required by each of us. There
were some challenges along the way with certain parts of the code, but we worked through them together, ensuring help was provided when needed.

The following links to the project are provided below:

Some reflection questions:  
* `What would you do differently?`
    * If I were to do this project again, one thing I would do differently is being more collaborative and efficient when we both want to work on the project. We both worked on the main branch and at times this caused some problems if we both made changes to the document at the same time. It also made it to where we needed to check and make sure the other person wasn't working on the project when we wanted to. Next time, I would utilize branches so that way we can both work on the project at the same time. That, and it would be more consistent with how it takes place in industry. The second thing I would do differently is understanding the data better before jumping in and doing the analysis.
* `What was the most difficult part for you?`
    * The most difficult part was fitting some of the models on the data and the long load times. We were not sure if this had to do with the size of the data or how we cleaned the data and stored certain columns. Often, the model would not finish training and we were left constantly needing to terminate the console. There also presented some challenges getting the exact syntax correct for each of the models, especially the two new ones, and how to get the proper probability predictions to use for log loss.
* `What are your big take-aways from this project?`
    * Most of my takeaways were listed above, but specifically related to the process was making sure to give yourself ample time to work through mistakes and errors in the code. Also to have patience through the process and take a break when stuck and come back with a fresh set of eyes. Lastly, ensure you have a good understanding of the data before you jump in. This can save headaches down the line with the analysis and how you set up certain models.
