# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Response Post

`Prompt`"
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is often the first step of dealing with data.  However, EDA is somewhat of an art and something that you get better at with experience. 
Often people new to EDA don't know what they should be looking for!
For your blog post, write up the strategy you use for EDA. What is your overall goal when doing an EDA? What methods do you think are important? What things do you try to look for?

After reading through the articles provided, it seems one of the most challenging components of EDA is knowing where to start or what to look for. It seems like an easy task
to jump straight into the data without first having a higher level goal of understanding your data and what you want to uncover through your analysis. EDA seems to be a crucial 
component before one jumps into modeling the data, as many problems can arise later on if one does not have a solid understanding of the different characteristics of the data they 
are working with. My overall goal when doing an EDA is to summarise the main components of the data in a meaningful way, largely through visualizations and tables. I really enjoyed 
the last article, that mentioned "EDA is an approach to data analysis that postpones the usual assumptions about what kind of model the data follow with the more direct approach of 
allowing the data itself to reveal its underlying structure and model." This largely speaks to the idea of letting the data itself reveal the insights and tell a story as opposed to 
trying to make the data work to your preferences and assumptions. When summarizing the main components, I think it's first helpful to understand who the project is for. In the workforce,
if your organization or boss comes to you to summarise a data set, I think it's crucial to understand the overall goal and objectives of the decision maker in what they're wanting, 
as well as the questions they want answered. A better understanding of the context and scope regarding the EDA can significantly guide the subsequent steps in the EDA. Once I have a 
good understanding of the intended audience of my EDA, as well as their overall objectives, I can formulate a strategy around summarizing the main characteristics. This includes 
understanding the sample and each of the features most important characteristics, such as the type of data and how I can categorize them. A solid understanding of the features can 
then lead to natural questions that may want to be further explored throughout the analysis. After gaining a well rounded understanding of the different attributes of my data, I'll want
to look at missing values, their frequencies, and where they show up the most. After examination, I'll want to further explore why there are missing values and how to mitigate them. 
After investigating the missing values, I'll want to do basic numerical summaries of the features of my data that include counts, summaries of center and spread, outliers, as well
as their distributions to understand the general shape. Some of the most important methods being contingency tables, bar charts, mean, variance, histograms, and box plots. I'll also look for
if my data is across time and how I can explore these summaries across each time period, or how they compare across different categorical variables. Once I understand the general
summaries of the individual features, I'll want to branch out and explore the features together, such as their correlation by utilizing a correlation matrix. All of these components
need to be well documented through writing, as well as visualizing where appropriate.
