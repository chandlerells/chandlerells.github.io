## Data Science Articles Response Post

`What do you think being a data scientist is about?`

I think being a data scientist is about helping businesses solve problems through the use of their data.
This may include tasks such as collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to draw insights
used in making informed decisions. This is often done through modeling the data and creating 
algorythings to draw out these insights.

`What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?`

The major duties include data cleansing, preparation, and analysis, as well as 
applying machine learning and predictive analytics to extract insights and 
predict future outcomes based on historical results. Knowledge areas include a 
strong programming background, specifically in languages such as R, Python, and SQL,
probability and statistics, machine learning, and different types of data such as 
structured and unstructured.

`What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?`

The primary differences that I see are that data science is typically more broad and 
focuses more on machine learning and automation. They potentially work with larger data
sets that aren't as clean, spending more time cleaning and wrangling the data. I see 
numerous similarities on how to approach a problem, tools used to understand the data, 
and formalizing models to interpret results. Both fields use statistical analysis and 
have a strong background in programming.

`How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?`

I find myself interested in the tasks and duties of data scientists, but wanting to 
understand more of the theory behind many of the models and algorithms used.
