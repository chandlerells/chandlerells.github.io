## ST 558: Blog Bio

My name is `Chandler Ellsworth` and this is my blog for my *ST 558* class. I am currently a first year **masters** student at `NC State` in the department of statistics. I previously attended `Texas A&M` University, where I received a **bachelors** in `accounting` and **masters** in `financial management`. Upon graduation, while working in the `renewables` sector, I quickly grew an interest in working with `data` and how to extract meaningful insights using `statistical methods`. Upon graduation, I hope to work as a `data scientist`.

This site is intended for:
* Responding to prompts proposed in my class
* Gaining familiarity with git and github
* Better understanding of the similarities and differences between statistics and data science

Feel free to reach me at `ckellswo@ncsu.edu`
